  This is the Balex Shop Attendant Calculator is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to assist shop attendants in efficiently calculating the total price of products based on the product's name, unit price, and quantity.
  The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface with functionalities tailored to the needs of shop attendants who require quick calculations without the need for storing data in a database. The app also includes additional features like clearing fields, printing, and saving calculations for later use.

#Key Features

1.1 Product Input Fields
    The app allows the shop attendant to input the Product Name, Unit Price, and Quantity. These fields are designed with clear labels and easy-to-read text fields for quick input.

1.2 Total Price Calculation

    After entering the product details, the user can calculate the total cost by multiplying the unit price by the quantity. This ensures accurate billing for customers.

1.3 Clear Button
    The app includes a clear button that resets all fields (Product Name, Unit Price, and Quantity) and clears the total, allowing the shop attendant to start a new calculation quickly.

    The app is designed to work on multiple screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both small mobile phones and larger tablets.
